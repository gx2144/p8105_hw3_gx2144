\*\*There are 7 state which were observed at 7 or more locations in
2002.They were CT,FL,RI,MA,PA,NV,NJ.NC and NJ were observed most, in
which 10 locations have been observed.

\*\*There are 11 state which were observed at 7 or more locations in
2002.They were CA,ME,OH,NV,ID,MA,NJ,TX,MD,PA,FL.FL were observed most,
in which 48 locations have been observed.Compared to 2002,more states
were observed and more locations were surveyed.And there were big
differences between the choice of state where the survey was
conducted.Changes between 2002 and 2010 reflect potential public health
concerns given by the investigators.

## problem 3

``` r
options(digits=4)

accelerometer = read.csv("./accel_data.csv") %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  mutate(
    dayorweekends = recode(day,
      Friday = "weekdays",
      Thursday = "weekdays",
      Wednesday = "weekdays",
      Tuesday = "weekdays",
      Monday = "weekdays",
      Saturday = "weekdend",
      Sunday = "weekdend")
    ) %>% 
  select(dayorweekends,everything()) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    activity.1:activity.1440,
    names_to = "activity",
    values_to = "avtivity count"
    
  )
```

\*\* Descirption: In this chart, column names are
dayorweekends,week,day\_id,day,activity and activity count.
“dayorweekends” denotes whether the day is weekday or weekends;“week”
denotes the nth week of the activity’“day\_id” denotes the order of the
day;“activity” denotes the time of the record in a day;“activity count”
denotes the count of each activity. Each day, there are 24\*60 =1440
times of activity records and this record last for 5 weeks,equals to 35
days. So the sum of the acitivity counts is 50400, which is the same as
the row number here.
